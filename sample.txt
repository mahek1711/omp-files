In the subsequent section, we will conduct a series of experiments using each of these approaches, aiming to compare their respective performance. Notably, we observe a significant advantage in favor of the second approach. The metrics employed to discern these differences include speedup, data movement, and the communication-to-computation ratio. Despite the fact that the second approach entails slightly more communication, the data clearly shows that it surpasses the first approach in certain metrics. This illustrates the viability of the second approach in various other domains as well. Furthermore, this research delves into additional optimizations that can be implemented on top of this approach to achieve even greater performance enhancements.
